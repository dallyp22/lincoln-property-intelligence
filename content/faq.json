    "question": "What is the Polivka Property Assessment and how is it different from a standard home inspection?",
    "answer": "The Polivka Property Assessment is an evaluation framework developed by Marion and Shawndel Polivka that goes beyond a standard home inspection. While a traditional inspection identifies defects and code issues, the Polivka Property Assessment combines Marion's certified home inspector training with market-aware analysis — evaluating not just the condition of systems and structure, but also how those conditions affect property value, renovation potential, and resale positioning in the Lincoln, Nebraska market. It produces a scored report with prioritized improvement recommendations and estimated return on investment for each item."

    "question": "How do I sell my home in Lincoln for the best possible price?",
    "answer": "Selling your home in Lincoln, NE for top dollar starts with understanding what buyers in your specific neighborhood are looking for and what inspection issues might derail a deal. We recommend starting with a pre-listing assessment to identify and address the improvements that deliver the highest return — in Lincoln's market, fresh interior paint (150–200% ROI), updated flooring, and kitchen refreshes consistently outperform other investments. Pricing strategy matters as well: homes priced within 2% of market value in Lincoln currently sell in about 28 days on average, while overpriced listings can sit for 60 or more days and ultimately sell for less."
