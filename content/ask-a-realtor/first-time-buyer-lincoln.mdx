Buying your first home is one of the most exciting — and sometimes overwhelming — decisions you will make. As someone who grew up in Lincoln, has personally renovated multiple homes here, and helps first-time buyers navigate this market regularly, I want to give you an honest, practical guide to making your first Lincoln home purchase with confidence.

## Why Lincoln Is Great for First-Time Buyers

Let me start with the good news. Lincoln, Nebraska offers first-time buyers several advantages that many cities simply cannot match:

**Affordable relative to income.** Lincoln's median home price hovers around $308,000 — significantly below the national median. Meanwhile, Lincoln's job market is strong with unemployment consistently below 3%, meaning your income-to-housing-cost ratio is favorable.

**Below-average cost of living.** Lincoln's overall cost of living runs approximately 6% below the national average. Lower housing costs, reasonable property taxes, and affordable groceries and utilities mean more of your income goes toward building equity rather than just surviving.

**Strong assistance programs.** Nebraska offers several first-time buyer assistance programs that can significantly reduce your upfront costs (more on this below).

**Stable market.** Lincoln does not experience the dramatic boom-bust cycles seen in coastal markets. Home values here appreciate steadily — typically 3–5% annually — providing reliable long-term wealth building without the volatility risk.

## Step 1: Get Your Finances Ready

Before you start browsing listings, take these financial steps:

### Check Your Credit Score

Most lenders want a minimum credit score of 620 for conventional loans, and 580 for FHA loans. Check your score through your bank or a free service, and address any errors or outstanding issues well before you apply.

### Calculate Your Budget

A common rule of thumb is that your monthly housing payment (mortgage, taxes, insurance) should not exceed 28% of your gross monthly income. In Lincoln, here is what that looks like for common income levels:

- **$60,000 household income:** ~$1,400/month, supporting a purchase price around $220,000–$250,000
- **$80,000 household income:** ~$1,867/month, supporting a purchase price around $290,000–$330,000
- **$100,000 household income:** ~$2,333/month, supporting a purchase price around $360,000–$410,000

These are estimates. Your actual numbers depend on interest rates, down payment, property taxes, and insurance costs.

### Save for Upfront Costs

Beyond the down payment, plan for:

- **Home inspection:** $350–$550 (plus optional radon, sewer scope)
- **Appraisal fee:** $400–$600
- **Closing costs:** Typically 2–4% of the purchase price in Lancaster County
- **Moving costs:** $1,000–$3,000 for a local Lincoln move
- **Immediate repairs or purchases:** Budget at least $2,000–$3,000 for items the home needs right away

### Get Pre-Approved

A pre-approval letter from a lender tells sellers you are serious and qualified. It also clarifies your exact budget. I recommend working with a local Lincoln lender who understands the Nebraska market — they are often more responsive and flexible than national online lenders.

## Step 2: Understand Your Financing Options

### Conventional Loans

- **Down payment:** As low as 3% with programs like Fannie Mae HomeReady
- **PMI:** Required below 20% down, typically $80–$200/month in Lincoln's price range
- **Best for:** Buyers with good credit (700+) and moderate savings

### FHA Loans

- **Down payment:** 3.5% minimum
- **Mortgage insurance:** Required for the life of the loan (both upfront and monthly)
- **Best for:** Buyers with lower credit scores (580–680) or limited savings

### USDA Loans

- **Down payment:** 0% — yes, zero down
- **Eligibility:** Property must be in a USDA-eligible area. Some areas on Lincoln's outskirts qualify.
- **Best for:** Buyers willing to look at properties in qualifying rural-adjacent areas

### Nebraska Down Payment Assistance

The Nebraska Investment Finance Authority (NIFA) offers the Homebuyer Assistance Program, which provides up to 5% of the purchase price toward down payment and closing costs. This is a second mortgage with favorable terms, and it can be combined with FHA or conventional first mortgages.

Lincoln's Urban Development Department also offers periodic assistance programs for qualifying buyers. These programs have income limits and property requirements, but they can provide thousands of dollars in help.

## Step 3: Choose the Right Neighborhood

For first-time buyers in Lincoln, I consistently recommend exploring these areas:

### Colonial Hills ($230,000–$310,000)

Excellent value, solid schools, established community. The homes are predominantly 1970s–1990s construction with generous lot sizes. This is where many Lincoln families start, and the appreciation has been steady.

### University Place ($180,000–$270,000)

One of Lincoln's most affordable neighborhoods with proximity to UNL, local shops, and a strong community identity. Homes here trend older (1920s–1960s), so inspection is especially important — but the character and location are hard to beat at this price.

### Near South ($160,000–$300,000)

Lincoln's most diverse neighborhood in terms of housing types and price points. You will find everything from $160,000 starter homes to $300,000 fully renovated craftsman-style properties. The walkability to downtown, restaurants, and the Haymarket district is a significant lifestyle perk.

### South Pointe ($270,000–$380,000)

For buyers at the higher end of the first-time range, South Pointe offers newer construction (2000s–2010s), excellent schools, and quick access to south Lincoln retail. Less renovation risk and more move-in-ready options.

## Step 4: Make the Inspection Non-Negotiable

This is where Marion and I are particularly passionate. As a first-time buyer, a thorough home inspection is your single most important protection. Marion's certified home inspector training means he can often identify potential issues during initial showings — before you even write an offer.

For first-time buyers in Lincoln, I especially recommend:

- **Standard home inspection** ($350–$550) — Always, no exceptions
- **Radon testing** ($150–$200) — Nebraska has elevated radon levels statewide
- **Sewer scope** ($150–$250) — Essential for any home older than 25 years
- **Termite/pest inspection** ($75–$125) — Lincoln's wood-frame homes are susceptible

Do not waive your inspection contingency to win a bidding war unless you fully understand and accept the risk. A $500 inspection can save you $20,000 in surprise repairs.

## Step 5: Navigate the Offer and Negotiation

When you find the right home, your agent should help you with:

- **Competitive offer strategy** — based on current Lincoln market conditions, not emotions
- **Inspection contingency** — protecting your right to renegotiate or walk away based on findings
- **Financing contingency** — ensuring you are not locked in if your loan falls through
- **Closing timeline** — typically 30–45 days from accepted offer in Lincoln
- **Earnest money** — usually $1,000–$3,000 in Lincoln, demonstrating your commitment

## Step 6: Understand Ongoing Costs

First-time buyers are sometimes surprised by the ongoing costs of homeownership. In Lincoln, budget for:

- **Lancaster County property taxes:** Approximately 1.8–2.1% of assessed value annually
- **Homeowner's insurance:** $1,200–$2,400/year depending on coverage and home age
- **Maintenance reserve:** Budget 1% of home value annually ($2,500–$3,500 for most first-time purchases)
- **Utilities:** $200–$400/month depending on home size and season (Lincoln winters drive heating costs up)

## Common First-Time Buyer Mistakes

Having guided many first-time buyers through this process, here are the mistakes I see most often:

1. **Shopping before getting pre-approved** — falling in love with a home you cannot afford
2. **Ignoring the inspection** — saving $500 now to spend $15,000 later
3. **Maxing out the budget** — buying at the top of your approval leaves no margin for life
4. **Choosing the house over the neighborhood** — a great house in a declining area is a poor investment
5. **Making major purchases before closing** — buying a car or furniture on credit can tank your loan approval
