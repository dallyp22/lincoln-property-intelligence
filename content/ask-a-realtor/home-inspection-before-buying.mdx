  - question: "Why do I need a home inspection before buying in Lincoln?"
    answer: "A home inspection protects you from costly surprises by identifying structural, mechanical, electrical, and plumbing issues before you close. In Lincoln, common issues include foundation problems from clay soils, aging HVAC systems, outdated electrical panels, and moisture intrusion in basements — problems that can cost $5,000 to $30,000+ to repair."
  - question: "How much does a home inspection cost in Lincoln, Nebraska?"
    answer: "A standard home inspection in Lincoln typically costs $350–$550 depending on the size and age of the home. Specialized inspections for radon, sewer scope, and mold may add $150–$400 each but are often well worth the investment for older Lincoln properties."

In my years of real estate experience — including certified home inspector training and hands-on renovation work on multiple investment properties — I have seen what happens when buyers skip or rush through a home inspection. The short version: it is never worth the money you think you are saving.

Let me explain why a thorough home inspection is especially important when buying in Lincoln, Nebraska, and what you should expect from the process.

## The Case for Never Skipping an Inspection

I understand the temptation. The Lincoln market can move quickly, and some buyers worry that an inspection contingency will make their offer less competitive. But consider this: the average home inspection costs $350–$550. The average cost of a major surprise after closing — a failed HVAC system, a foundation issue, a sewer line collapse — ranges from $5,000 to $30,000 or more.

That inspection fee is the best insurance policy you will ever purchase.

Even in situations where you choose to waive the inspection contingency to strengthen your offer (something I only recommend in very specific circumstances), I still encourage buyers to get an informational inspection. You want to know what you are buying, even if you have decided you are buying it regardless.

## What a Home Inspector Checks

A comprehensive home inspection covers the major systems and structural elements of the property:

### Structural Components
- Foundation walls, footings, and slab
- Framing members and load-bearing walls
- Basement and crawl space condition
- Settlement and movement indicators

### Exterior Systems
- Roof covering, flashing, and gutters
- Siding and exterior cladding
- Grading and drainage around the foundation
- Driveways, walkways, and attached structures

### Mechanical Systems
- HVAC system (furnace, air conditioner, ductwork)
- Water heater age and condition
- Plumbing supply and drain lines
- Electrical panel, wiring, and outlets

### Interior Elements
- Windows and doors (operation and sealing)
- Insulation and ventilation
- Kitchen appliances
- Bathroom fixtures and moisture evidence
- Garage structure and door operation

## Common Issues I See in Lincoln Homes

Having walked through hundreds of Lincoln properties with my inspector-trained eye, certain issues come up repeatedly based on the age and location of the home.

### Homes Built Before 1960 (Near South, University Place, College View)

Lincoln's older neighborhoods are full of character, but they also carry the maintenance realities of their era:

- **Knob-and-tube or cloth-wrapped wiring** — Common in pre-1950 homes. Insurance companies may require upgrading before issuing a policy. Rewiring a 1,500-square-foot home typically costs $8,000–$15,000.
- **Cast iron drain lines** — Homes built before 1960 often have original cast iron sewer lines that develop cracks and blockages. A sewer scope inspection ($150–$250) is essential for these properties.
- **Foundation issues** — Many older Lincoln homes sit on limestone or concrete block foundations. Decades of exposure to Lincoln's clay soils create cracking and moisture intrusion patterns that need careful evaluation.
- **Lead paint and asbestos** — Homes built before 1978 may contain lead paint. Homes with original insulation, flooring, or duct wrap from before 1980 may contain asbestos. Both require proper assessment and handling.

### Homes Built 1960–1990 (Witherbee, Colonial Hills, Indian Hills)

This era of Lincoln construction is generally solid, but common issues include:

- **Original HVAC systems nearing end of life** — Furnaces and air conditioners from this era are often 25–40 years old. Replacement costs run $6,000–$12,000 for a standard system.
- **FPE or Zinsco electrical panels** — Certain electrical panel brands from this era are considered fire hazards. Panel replacement costs $2,000–$4,000.
- **Basement moisture** — Even well-built homes from this era struggle with basement moisture in Lincoln's soil conditions. Look for evidence of water staining, efflorescence (white mineral deposits), and dehumidifier usage.

### Homes Built After 2000 (Piedmont, Fallbrook, Wilderness Hills)

Newer homes have fewer systemic issues, but they are not immune:

- **Settling cracks** — New construction in Lincoln's clay soils often develops cosmetic settling cracks in the first 5–10 years.
- **Grading issues** — Builder grading sometimes settles over time, directing water toward the foundation instead of away from it.
- **Cosmetic defects** — Rushed construction during boom periods can leave nail pops, drywall seams, and trim gaps that are cosmetic but annoying.

## Specialized Inspections Worth Adding

Beyond the standard inspection, I recommend these additional evaluations for Lincoln properties:

**Radon testing ($150–$200):** Nebraska has some of the highest radon levels in the country. Lincoln is no exception. Radon is a colorless, odorless gas that seeps through foundations and is the second leading cause of lung cancer. Testing is inexpensive, and mitigation systems (if needed) typically cost $800–$1,500.

**Sewer scope ($150–$250):** For any home older than 30 years, a camera inspection of the sewer line from the house to the city main can reveal root intrusion, bellies (low spots that collect debris), and cracking. Sewer line replacement costs $5,000–$15,000, making this a wise investment.

**Mold inspection ($300–$500):** If you see evidence of past water damage or the home has a strong musty odor, a professional mold assessment can identify the species and extent of contamination. This is particularly relevant for homes with basement finishing that may be concealing moisture issues.

## How I Help Buyers During the Inspection Process

My approach goes beyond what most agents provide during the inspection period. Because of my certified home inspector training and renovation experience, I am able to:

1. **Pre-screen properties** — During initial showings, I identify potential issues that will likely appear on the formal inspection. This saves buyers from falling in love with a property that has deal-breaking problems.
2. **Attend the inspection** — I attend every inspection with my buyers, asking questions and noting items that the inspector flags.
3. **Contextualize findings** — An inspection report can list 50 items. I help buyers distinguish between the five that actually matter and the cosmetic items that are easy fixes.
4. **Estimate repair costs** — My renovation and construction background means I can provide realistic cost estimates for identified issues, helping buyers make informed negotiation decisions.
5. **Negotiate effectively** — With a clear understanding of what repairs actually cost, I help buyers negotiate credits or repairs that reflect real market value, not inflated contractor bids.

## Protecting Your Investment

A home purchase is likely the largest financial decision you will make. Spending $350–$550 on a professional inspection — plus a few hundred more for radon and sewer scope — is a trivial cost relative to the protection it provides.

If you are buying in Lincoln and want an agent who understands property condition at a level most agents simply cannot match, reach out to the Polivka team. Marion's inspection training and renovation experience mean you have an informed advocate at every step of the process.
