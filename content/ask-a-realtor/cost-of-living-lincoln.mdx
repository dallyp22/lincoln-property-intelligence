When people consider relocating to Lincoln, Nebraska — whether for a job, for family, or simply for a better quality of life — one of their first questions is about affordability. Having lived in Lincoln my entire life and helped families move here from across the country, I can give you an honest, detailed picture of what it actually costs to live here.

The short answer: Lincoln is significantly more affordable than most mid-sized American cities, and your dollar goes considerably further than the national average.

Here is the detailed breakdown.

## Housing: Lincoln's Biggest Advantage

Housing is where Lincoln truly shines in cost-of-living comparisons.

### Home Purchasing

- **Lincoln median home price:** Approximately $308,000
- **National median home price:** Approximately $420,000
- **Savings:** Roughly 27% below national average

But the median does not tell the whole story. Lincoln offers strong options across a wide range:

- **Entry-level homes** (Near South, University Place): $160,000–$250,000
- **Mid-range family homes** (Colonial Hills, Indian Hills): $250,000–$350,000
- **Premium homes** (Piedmont, Wilderness Hills): $350,000–$550,000+
- **Luxury properties** (custom builds, acreages): $550,000+

For a family earning $80,000 per year, this means homeownership is genuinely accessible in Lincoln — not just technically possible but actually comfortable.

### Renting

Lincoln's rental market is equally favorable:

- **Average 1-bedroom apartment:** $750–$950/month
- **Average 2-bedroom apartment:** $900–$1,200/month
- **Average 3-bedroom house rental:** $1,100–$1,500/month
- **National average 2-bedroom:** Approximately $1,400–$1,600/month

Rents in Lincoln run 30–40% below national averages, which is remarkable for a city with a strong job market and growing population.

## Property Taxes

Nebraska property taxes are higher than the national average — this is the one area where Lincoln's affordability story has a caveat.

- **Lancaster County effective property tax rate:** Approximately 1.8–2.1% of assessed value
- **National average effective rate:** Approximately 1.1%

For a $300,000 home, you would pay roughly $5,400–$6,300 in annual property taxes. While this is higher than states like Iowa (1.5%) or Colorado (0.5%), it is important to context: Nebraska has no county or city income tax, and the state income tax rates are moderate. When you look at total tax burden — property taxes, income taxes, and sales taxes combined — Nebraska is middle of the pack nationally.

The Nebraska Homestead Exemption provides property tax relief for qualifying homeowners, including seniors, disabled individuals, and some veterans. Check eligibility if you think you may qualify.

## Utilities

Lincoln's utility costs are generally below national averages, with seasonal variation due to Nebraska's continental climate.

### Monthly Averages for a 1,500-Square-Foot Home

- **Electricity:** $80–$130/month (Lincoln Electric System rates are competitive)
- **Natural gas:** $40–$80/month (summer) to $120–$200/month (winter heating)
- **Water and sewer:** $50–$80/month
- **Trash and recycling:** $25–$35/month (included in some areas)
- **Internet:** $50–$80/month (Allo Fiber is widely available with gigabit speeds)

**Total typical monthly utilities:** $250–$400/month, varying significantly by season.

Lincoln's winter heating costs are the biggest variable. Older homes in Near South or University Place with original insulation and aging furnaces can see winter gas bills of $200+ per month. This is one reason Marion always evaluates insulation and HVAC efficiency during property walkthroughs — it directly impacts your monthly cost of living.

## Groceries and Dining

Lincoln's grocery costs are approximately 3–5% below the national average:

- **Weekly groceries for a family of four:** $150–$200
- **Gallon of milk:** $3.50–$4.00
- **Dozen eggs:** $3.00–$4.50
- **Loaf of bread:** $2.50–$3.50

Lincoln has a strong local food scene, with Hy-Vee, Super Saver, and Trader Joe's providing competitive grocery pricing. The Haymarket Farmers Market (seasonal) offers locally grown produce at reasonable prices.

Dining out in Lincoln is notably affordable:

- **Casual restaurant meal for two:** $25–$40
- **Mid-range restaurant dinner for two:** $50–$80
- **Fast casual lunch:** $10–$15

The Haymarket district, downtown, and South 27th Street corridor offer diverse dining options that rival much larger cities — at significantly lower price points.

## Transportation

Lincoln is primarily a car-dependent city, but transportation costs remain manageable:

- **Average gas price:** In line with the national average, typically $3.00–$3.50/gallon
- **Average commute time:** 18–22 minutes (significantly below the national average of 27 minutes)
- **Car insurance:** $1,200–$1,800/year for full coverage (below the national average)
- **StarTran public transit:** $1.75 per ride, with a monthly pass available for $50

The short commute times are an underrated cost savings. In cities with 45-minute average commutes, you are spending more on gas, more on vehicle wear, and — critically — losing more of your day. Lincoln's compact footprint means most residents live within 20 minutes of their workplace.

## Healthcare

Healthcare costs in Lincoln are roughly in line with national averages:

- **Average annual healthcare spending per person:** Approximately $5,000–$6,000
- **Primary care visit (no insurance):** $150–$250
- **Lincoln's major health systems:** Bryan Health, CHI Health St. Elizabeth, and the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) satellite facilities

Lincoln has excellent healthcare access for a city of its size, with two major hospital systems and a strong network of specialists. This is a significant quality-of-life factor, especially for families with children or aging parents.

## Childcare and Education

- **Average daycare cost (infant, full-time):** $800–$1,200/month
- **Average daycare cost (preschool age):** $600–$900/month
- **National average infant daycare:** $1,200–$1,500/month

Lincoln's childcare costs are below the national average, though they still represent a significant expense for young families. Lincoln Public Schools, which I have written about in detail in our school districts guide, is a strong district that offers quality public education across the city.

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln also brings cultural and educational enrichment — museums, lectures, athletics, and community events — much of it free or low-cost.

## How Lincoln Compares to Nearby Cities

### Lincoln vs. Omaha

Lincoln is generally 5–10% less expensive than Omaha overall. Housing is the primary difference, with Lincoln's median home price running $30,000–$40,000 below Omaha's. Groceries, dining, and utilities are comparable. Omaha offers more corporate job options and a larger metro area, while Lincoln provides a smaller city feel with university-town amenities.

### Lincoln vs. Kansas City

Lincoln is approximately 8–12% less expensive than Kansas City, with notably lower housing costs and comparable everyday expenses. Kansas City offers a larger entertainment and dining scene, while Lincoln provides a safer, more compact community.

### Lincoln vs. Des Moines

The two cities are quite comparable in overall cost of living, with Lincoln having a slight edge in housing affordability and Des Moines offering marginally lower property taxes due to Iowa's homestead credit program.

## The Real Bottom Line

What makes Lincoln's cost of living story compelling is not just the numbers — it is the quality of life those numbers buy. For the cost of a modest apartment in Denver or a small condo in Minneapolis, you can own a comfortable single-family home in a safe Lincoln neighborhood with good schools, a short commute, and access to a thriving local economy.
