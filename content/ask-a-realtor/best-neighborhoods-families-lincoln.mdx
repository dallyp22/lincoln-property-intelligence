Born and raised in Lincoln, Nebraska, I have watched this city's neighborhoods evolve through every stage of my own life — from growing up here, to buying our first home, to raising our family and renovating multiple properties along the way. When families ask me where they should look in Lincoln, I do not just pull up listings. I share what I know from decades of living in and loving this community.

Here is my honest guide to the neighborhoods where Lincoln families thrive.

## What Makes a Neighborhood Family-Friendly

Before diving into specific areas, let me share the criteria I use when helping families find their neighborhood. It goes beyond just school ratings:

- **School quality and proximity** — Not just test scores, but school culture, extracurriculars, and parent engagement
- **Safety and walkability** — Can your kids ride bikes to a friend's house? Are there sidewalks and low-traffic streets?
- **Parks and recreation access** — Lincoln has an incredible trail and park system, but proximity varies by neighborhood
- **Community feel** — Do neighbors know each other? Are there block parties, community events, or active HOAs that maintain standards?
- **Home value stability** — A family home is likely your biggest investment. It should hold and grow its value.
- **Commute practicality** — How long does it take to get to work, school, groceries, and activities?

## Piedmont

**Price range:** $300,000–$450,000 | **Best for:** Growing families wanting newer construction

Piedmont, located in southeast Lincoln, has become one of the city's most sought-after family neighborhoods over the past decade. The homes here are predominantly 2000s and 2010s construction, meaning you get modern floor plans, energy-efficient systems, and fewer maintenance surprises — something Marion always appreciates from an inspection standpoint.

The schools serving Piedmont are consistently among Lincoln's highest rated. Families here have access to excellent elementary options, and the area feeds into strong middle and high school programs. The neighborhood features wide streets, well-maintained common areas, and easy access to Holmes Lake Park for biking, fishing, and summer picnics.

**My take:** Piedmont is ideal if your budget allows it and you want move-in ready homes with minimal renovation needs. The community is active and family-oriented, and the home values have shown strong appreciation.

## Wilderness Hills

**Price range:** $350,000–$550,000+ | **Best for:** Families seeking upscale community with amenities

South of Piedmont, Wilderness Hills represents Lincoln's premium family living. This master-planned community features walking trails, community pools, and a neighborhood design that encourages outdoor living. The homes here are larger — typically 2,200 to 3,500 square feet — with higher-end finishes.

The schools are excellent, and the neighborhood's location provides quick access to both south Lincoln retail corridors and the Homestead Expressway for downtown commutes. Many families in Wilderness Hills work at Bryan Health, the University of Nebraska, or state government — all within a 15 to 20 minute drive.

**My take:** If your budget supports it, Wilderness Hills offers the full package. However, I always remind buyers that higher price points do not automatically mean zero issues. Even newer homes benefit from Marion's trained eye during the buying process.

## Colonial Hills

**Price range:** $230,000–$310,000 | **Best for:** First-time family buyers seeking value

Colonial Hills, in east Lincoln near 70th and Vine, is where I often steer families who want strong schools and community without stretching their budget to its limit. This established neighborhood features 1970s through 1990s construction — mostly ranch and split-level homes on generous lots.

The school options are solid, the parks are well maintained, and the neighborhood has a genuine community feel that some newer developments have not yet established. Grocery stores, restaurants, and retail are minutes away along 70th Street.

From a housing perspective, Colonial Hills offers excellent square footage for the price. Many homes here have been updated by their owners over the years, so you will find everything from original-condition ranches (great for buyers who want to renovate on their own terms) to fully modernized homes.

**My take:** This is one of Lincoln's best-value family neighborhoods. The homes are well-built, the lots are substantial, and the community is established. Marion and I have personal experience with homes in this area, and the construction quality from this era is generally solid.

## Indian Hills

**Price range:** $280,000–$380,000 | **Best for:** Families wanting established neighborhoods with character

Indian Hills sits in south-central Lincoln and offers something the newer developments cannot: mature trees, established landscaping, and a settled community where neighbors have known each other for years. Homes here were primarily built in the 1960s through 1980s, offering a mix of ranch, split-level, and two-story designs.

The schools are well-regarded, and the neighborhood's central location means shorter commutes to downtown, UNL, and major employers. Antelope Park and Sunken Gardens are nearby, giving families beautiful green space for weekends.

**My take:** Indian Hills appeals to families who value character and location over brand-new construction. The trade-off is that homes from this era may need updates to kitchens, bathrooms, and mechanical systems. That is where having an agent who understands construction quality and renovation costs — like Marion — becomes invaluable during the buying process.

## Fallbrook

**Price range:** $290,000–$420,000 | **Best for:** Families seeking newer development with growth potential

Located in northwest Lincoln near North 27th Street, Fallbrook is one of Lincoln's newer family-oriented developments. The neighborhood features contemporary home designs, community green spaces, and a growing roster of nearby retail and dining options.

Families in Fallbrook appreciate the newer construction (mostly 2010s and 2020s), the proximity to the Highlands neighborhood and north Lincoln's expanding commercial corridor, and the access to excellent school facilities. The area is still growing, which means you are getting in at prices that have room for appreciation as development continues.

**My take:** Fallbrook is a smart choice for families who want new or near-new construction at a more accessible price point than south Lincoln's premium neighborhoods. The northwest corridor is Lincoln's primary growth area, and buying here now positions you well for future value increases.

## Other Neighborhoods Worth Considering

- **Yankee Hill:** South Lincoln, strong schools, mix of price points from $260,000–$380,000
- **South Pointe:** Southeast Lincoln, newer development, excellent parks and trail access
- **The Highlands:** Northwest Lincoln, emerging area with strong growth trajectory and newer schools

## What to Watch Out For

As a Lincoln native and someone who has personally renovated multiple homes here, let me share a few things I wish every family buyer knew:

1. **School boundaries change.** Always verify current attendance zones directly with Lincoln Public Schools before making an offer based on school assignment.
2. **Flood zones matter.** Some otherwise excellent Lincoln neighborhoods have pockets that fall within FEMA flood zones. We check this for every property we show.
3. **HOA restrictions vary wildly.** In newer neighborhoods like Wilderness Hills and Fallbrook, HOAs maintain property values but also restrict fencing, landscaping, and exterior modifications. Know what you are agreeing to.
4. **Do not skip the inspection.** Even in a competitive market, Marion's inspection-trained eye has saved our buyers tens of thousands of dollars on homes that looked perfect on the surface.

## Finding Your Family's Lincoln Neighborhood

Every family is different. Your budget, your commute, your school preferences, and your lifestyle priorities all factor into the right neighborhood choice. The beauty of Lincoln is that strong family options exist across a wide price range — you do not have to spend $500,000 to find a great place to raise your kids.
