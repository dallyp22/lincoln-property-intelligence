  - question: "How do school districts work for home buyers in Lincoln, Nebraska?"
    answer: "Lincoln Public Schools (LPS) serves the entire city with attendance boundaries that determine which elementary, middle, and high school your child attends based on your home address. These boundaries are periodically adjusted as the city grows. Buyers should verify current boundaries directly with LPS before making purchase decisions based on school assignments."
  - question: "Can you choose which school your child attends in Lincoln?"
    answer: "LPS offers an open enrollment process that allows families to request a school outside their attendance boundary. Approval depends on available capacity at the requested school. Magnet programs and focus programs also provide options beyond neighborhood attendance zones. However, transportation is typically the family's responsibility for open enrollment transfers."

One of the first questions I hear from families moving to Lincoln — or moving within the city — is about schools. As a Lincoln native and someone who has helped countless families navigate school boundary questions during their home search, I want to give you a clear understanding of how Lincoln Public Schools works and how it should factor into your home buying decision.

## How Lincoln Public Schools Is Organized

Lincoln Public Schools (LPS) is a single district serving the entire city of Lincoln and some surrounding areas. Unlike metro areas where you might have multiple competing districts, Lincoln has one unified system. This means:

- **All Lincoln homes are in the same district** — LPS
- **Attendance boundaries determine your assigned school** — Based on your home address
- **Boundaries exist at three levels** — Elementary, middle school, and high school
- **Boundaries can change** — LPS periodically adjusts boundaries as the city grows and enrollment patterns shift

LPS operates approximately 40 elementary schools, 12 middle schools, and 6 comprehensive high schools, plus several alternative and focus programs.

## High School Attendance Areas and Neighborhoods

For many families, the high school attendance area is the primary school-related factor in their home purchase. Here is how Lincoln's major high schools align with popular neighborhoods:

### Lincoln Southwest

**Neighborhoods served:** Piedmont, Wilderness Hills, portions of south Lincoln

Lincoln Southwest is one of LPS's newer high schools and has quickly developed strong academic and athletic programs. The school serves many of Lincoln's newer, family-oriented neighborhoods in the southwest quadrant. Families moving to Piedmont or Wilderness Hills will typically feed into Southwest.

### Lincoln Southeast

**Neighborhoods served:** Indian Hills, Colonial Hills, portions of east and southeast Lincoln

Southeast has a long-standing reputation for strong academics, particularly in science and college preparation. The school draws from established neighborhoods with diverse housing stock, making it accessible to families across a range of budgets.

### Lincoln East

**Neighborhoods served:** East Lincoln neighborhoods, portions of the eastern growth corridor

Lincoln East serves a broad section of east Lincoln and has historically been one of the larger high schools in the district. Strong extracurricular programs and a diverse student body reflect the varied neighborhoods in its attendance zone.

### Lincoln North Star

**Neighborhoods served:** Fallbrook, The Highlands, portions of north Lincoln

North Star is LPS's newest high school and serves the growing northwest corridor. As Lincoln's primary growth area, North Star's enrollment has been increasing steadily. The school has modern facilities and a growing roster of programs.

### Lincoln High

**Neighborhoods served:** Near South, University Place, downtown area

Lincoln High is the city's original high school, located near downtown. It serves Lincoln's historic central neighborhoods and has a diverse student body. The International Baccalaureate (IB) program at Lincoln High is nationally recognized and draws students from across the city through open enrollment.

### Lincoln Northeast

**Neighborhoods served:** Northeast Lincoln neighborhoods

Northeast serves the northeast quadrant of the city and has invested in career and technical education programs alongside traditional academics.

## Elementary and Middle School Considerations

While high school assignments get the most attention, elementary and middle school quality often matters more for families with younger children — these are the schools your kids will attend for the longest period.

Key considerations:

### Class Size and Resources

Elementary schools in high-growth areas like south and northwest Lincoln sometimes experience growing pains as enrollment outpaces facility capacity. LPS addresses this through redistricting and portable classrooms, but it is worth checking current enrollment numbers for your target school.

### Before and After School Programs

Many LPS elementary schools offer before and after school care programs, either through the district or community partners. Availability varies by school, so verify this if childcare is a factor in your family's planning.

### Walking Distance

For families who value walkability, your home's proximity to the elementary school is a daily quality-of-life factor. In established neighborhoods like Colonial Hills and Indian Hills, many homes are within walking distance of their assigned elementary school. In newer developments with larger footprints, bus service becomes more important.

## Magnet and Focus Programs

LPS offers several specialty programs that allow students to attend schools outside their boundary:

- **International Baccalaureate (IB)** at Lincoln High — A rigorous college-preparatory program recognized worldwide
- **Science Focus Program** at various locations — Enhanced science curriculum starting at the elementary level
- **Career Academy** — High school program offering career-focused pathways in healthcare, IT, business, and skilled trades
- **Arts and Humanities Focus** — Available at select schools

These programs expand your options beyond geography. If a specialty program is important to your family, you do not necessarily need to buy within that school's boundary — but transportation to and from the program school becomes your responsibility.

## Open Enrollment: How It Works

LPS allows families to request a school outside their attendance boundary through the open enrollment process:

1. **Submit a request** during the open enrollment window (typically February–March for the following school year)
2. **Approval is capacity-based** — If the requested school has space, the transfer is usually granted
3. **Transportation is not provided** — Families are responsible for getting their child to and from the transfer school
4. **Renewals are not guaranteed** — Open enrollment is approved annually, though most renewals are granted if the student maintains good standing

## How School Boundaries Affect Property Values

The relationship between school assignments and property values is real in Lincoln, though perhaps not as extreme as in some larger metro areas. Based on our market observations:

- **Homes in sought-after elementary boundaries** can command a 3–7% premium over comparable homes just across the boundary line
- **High school assignment** has a measurable but smaller impact, since families have more options (open enrollment, magnet programs) at the high school level
- **Proximity to the school** matters independently — homes within walking distance of well-regarded elementary schools are particularly desirable to families

However, I always remind buyers: school quality in Lincoln is strong across the district. LPS consistently ranks among Nebraska's top-performing districts. The differences between schools, while real, are less dramatic than in many metro areas.

## Verifying School Boundaries Before You Buy

This is critically important: never rely solely on a real estate listing's school information. Boundaries change, and listing data is sometimes outdated.

To verify your attendance area:

1. **Use the LPS Boundary Finder** — Available on the Lincoln Public Schools website, this tool lets you enter an address and see assigned schools at all levels
2. **Call the LPS enrollment office** — They can confirm current boundaries and notify you of any upcoming changes
3. **Ask your agent** — We track boundary changes as part of our neighborhood expertise and can alert you to recent or pending adjustments

## Our Advice to Families

After helping many families navigate school-related buying decisions in Lincoln, here is what we recommend:

1. **Visit the actual schools** — Ratings and test scores do not tell the whole story. Visit the schools you are considering, talk to teachers and parents, and get a feel for the culture.
2. **Consider the long game** — If your child is 3 years old, you are buying a home they will live in for at least 15 years. Think about middle and high school assignments, not just elementary.
3. **Do not overpay for a boundary** — If you love a home that is just outside your preferred school boundary, open enrollment may solve the problem at no additional cost.
4. **Check for boundary reviews** — LPS periodically reviews and adjusts boundaries. A home that is currently in one school's zone could be redistricted in the future.

Finding the right home in the right school boundary is a puzzle, but it is a solvable one. The Polivka team combines deep local school knowledge with Marion's property assessment expertise to help you find a home that works for your whole family — academically and structurally.
