    "question": "What is the Seller Readiness Score?",
    "answer": "The Seller Readiness Score is a free interactive tool designed specifically for Lincoln, Nebraska homeowners who are considering selling their property. It walks you through a series of guided questions about your home's condition, recent improvements, curb appeal, and market timing to produce a personalized readiness score from 0 to 100. The score helps you understand where your home stands relative to current Lincoln buyer expectations so you can prioritize the improvements that will make the biggest impact. Marion developed this tool drawing on her certified home inspector training and years of experience with the Polivka Property Assessment process to give sellers an honest, data-driven starting point before listing."

    "question": "How is the Seller Readiness Score calculated?",
    "answer": "The score is calculated by evaluating your answers across several weighted categories including structural and mechanical condition, interior updates, curb appeal, market timing, and pricing readiness. Each category carries a different weight based on what Lincoln buyers prioritize most heavily in the current market — for example, roof age and HVAC condition are weighted more heavily than cosmetic updates. The algorithm reflects real-world insights from hundreds of Lincoln transactions and incorporates principles from the Polivka Property Assessment, which examines a home from a buyer's perspective. Your final score is a composite number that tells you how prepared your home is to compete effectively in the Lincoln real estate market."

    "question": "What is the Polivka Property Assessment?",
    "answer": "The Polivka Property Assessment is a comprehensive, room-by-room evaluation of your home that Marion personally conducts before listing. Unlike a standard comparative market analysis, it examines your property through the eyes of a buyer and a trained inspector, identifying both strengths to highlight and issues that could derail a sale or reduce your net proceeds. Marion's background as a certified home inspector allows her to spot problems that most agents would overlook — from aging electrical panels to early signs of foundation settling common in Lincoln's clay-heavy soil. The assessment produces a prioritized action plan so you know exactly which repairs or updates will deliver the highest return on investment when selling in the Lincoln market."

    "question": "How long does the Seller Readiness Score take to complete?",
    "answer": "Most Lincoln homeowners complete the Seller Readiness Score questionnaire in about five to eight minutes. The questions are designed to be straightforward — you do not need to climb into your attic or pull up old receipts to answer them accurately. If you are unsure about specific details like your roof's age or furnace model, reasonable estimates work fine for generating a meaningful score. After you submit, your personalized results appear instantly on screen with clear category breakdowns and next-step recommendations tailored to the Lincoln market."

  {
    "question": "Is the Seller Readiness Score really free?",
    "answer": "Yes, the Seller Readiness Score is completely free with no strings attached. You will receive your full score, category-by-category breakdown, and general recommendations without paying anything or committing to a listing agreement. We built this tool because we believe Lincoln homeowners deserve honest, transparent information about where their home stands before making one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives. If your results suggest you would benefit from a full Polivka Property Assessment or a detailed listing consultation, Marion is happy to schedule one — but there is absolutely no obligation to do so."

  {
    "question": "What should I do if my score is low?",
    "answer": "A lower score does not mean you cannot sell — it simply means there are specific areas where targeted improvements could increase your home's appeal and net sale price in the Lincoln market. Your results page will highlight the categories dragging your score down and suggest practical next steps, from quick cosmetic fixes to more significant repairs. Many Lincoln sellers find that addressing just two or three high-impact items can move their score dramatically. Marion offers a complimentary follow-up call to walk through your results and help you decide which improvements are worth the investment versus which ones you can skip, drawing on her certified home inspector training to give you advice grounded in real building science rather than guesswork."

    "question": "How does certified home inspector training help when selling a home?",
    "answer": "Most real estate agents evaluate a home based on cosmetics and comparable sales, but Marion's certified home inspector training gives her the ability to assess a property's structural, mechanical, and safety systems the same way a buyer's inspector will. This means she can identify potential deal-breakers — like aging water heaters, grading issues, or outdated electrical — before they surface during the buyer's inspection and derail your closing timeline. In the Lincoln market, where many homes were built between the 1950s and 1980s, this expertise is especially valuable because era-specific issues like galvanized plumbing and original sewer lines are common. Sellers who work with Marion consistently report fewer inspection surprises, smoother negotiations, and stronger net proceeds because problems are addressed proactively rather than reactively."
  },
  {
    "question": "What happens after I complete the questionnaire?",
    "answer": "After you submit the questionnaire, you will immediately see your Seller Readiness Score along with a detailed breakdown showing how you scored in each category. You will also receive actionable recommendations ranked by impact so you know where to focus your time and budget. If you optionally provide your contact information, Marion will reach out to discuss your results and answer any questions about selling in your specific Lincoln neighborhood. From there, you can choose to schedule a full Polivka Property Assessment for an in-depth, in-person evaluation, request a comparative market analysis, or simply use the information on your own timeline — there is never any pressure to list before you are ready."
